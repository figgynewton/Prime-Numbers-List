# Prime-Numbers-List
Write a Boolean function named is_prime which takes an integer as an argument and returns
true if the argument is a prime number, or false otherwise. Use the function in a program that
prompts the user to enter a number then displays a message indicating whether the number is
prime.

Write another program that displays all of the prime numbers from 1 to 100. The
program should have a loop that calls the is_prime function.
